        Fit-out approval delays in Dubai are almost always avoidable. In our experience processing hundreds of approval submissions, the same mistakes appear again and again. Here are the 10 most common — and exactly how to fix each one.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Using an Unregistered Consultant</h2>
      <p>Dubai Municipality, Dubai Civil Defence, and most free zone authorities only accept submissions from registered, approved consultants. Submitting through an unregistered party causes immediate rejection — often without detailed feedback.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Verify your consultant's registration on the DM/DCD portal before signing any engagement. Ask to see their current registration certificate and confirm it covers your project type.</p>

      <h2>2. Skipping the Building Management NOC</h2>
      <p>Many applicants submit directly to DM without first obtaining the building management or developer NOC. DM requires this as part of the submission package. Missing it means your application is rejected at the documentation check stage — before any technical review even begins.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Contact building management or the master developer (Emaar, Nakheel, DAMAC, etc.) immediately after signing your lease. Some developers take 3–4 weeks to issue the NOC — start early.</p>

      <h2>3. Uncoordinated Drawings Between Disciplines</h2>
      <p>This is the single most common technical rejection reason. The architectural floor plan shows walls in one position, the MEP plan shows them in another. The electrical panel is shown in a different location on the power plan versus the lighting plan. Reviewers check coordination between all submitted drawings.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Run an internal coordination review before any submission. Check that column grids, wall positions, room names, and MEP elements are consistent across all drawings. A 30-minute check prevents 2-week delays.</p>

      <div className="pro-tip">
        <strong>Pro Tip</strong>
        Overlay your architectural and MEP plans digitally before submission. Every position discrepancy visible in the overlay will be caught by DM reviewers.

      <h2>4. Incomplete Drawing Sets</h2>
      <p>Submitting without a required drawing — no reflected ceiling plan, missing drainage plan, or absent electrical single-line diagram — triggers an immediate completeness rejection. DM portal submissions have a checklist, but the portal does not always enforce completeness.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Build a pre-submission checklist based on the DM submission requirements for your project type. Architecture, MEP, structural (if applicable), and all supporting documents should be checked against the list before upload.</p>

      <h2>5. Non-Compliant Toilet and Accessibility Requirements</h2>
      <p>DM enforces accessibility standards under the UAE Building Code. Toilets must meet minimum dimensions, door swing clearances, and accessible toilet requirements for commercial projects above certain sizes. This is a very common rejection comment for restaurant and office fit-outs.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Apply UAE accessibility standards from the start of layout design. Check toilet dimensions, door widths (minimum 900mm clear), accessible toilet requirements, and ramp gradients where applicable.</p>

      <h2>6. Missing Fire Exit Details</h2>
      <p>Dubai Civil Defence requires clearly dimensioned means of escape on the architectural floor plan. Missing exit widths, undimensioned corridors, or escape routes blocked by furniture/equipment layouts are all common reasons for DCD rejection.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Show all fire exits with clear width dimensions on every floor plan. Ensure exit routes are unobstructed and meet UAE Fire Code minimum widths (1200mm for corridors serving more than 50 people).</p>

      <h2>7. Wrong Application Category</h2>
      <p>Submitting a restaurant fit-out under an "office" category, or a clinic under "retail", means the wrong set of requirements is applied. The reviewer flags this and the application is sent back — sometimes after weeks in the queue.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Confirm the correct application category with your consultant before submission. For mixed-use spaces or unusual functions, confirm the category with DM before starting drawings.</p>

      <h2>8. Structural NOC Missing for Load-Bearing Modifications</h2>
      <p>Any work that touches load-bearing walls, columns, beams, or slabs requires a structural engineer's NOC confirming the modification is safe. Many applicants submit without this, assuming it is only required for major works. DM reviewers check carefully.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> If your fit-out involves any structural element — even a single opening in a concrete wall — engage a structural engineer early. Their NOC must accompany your DM submission.</p>

      <h2>9. Submitting Before Site Survey</h2>
      <p>Drawings that do not match existing site conditions are caught either at DM review or at site inspection. This is especially common in older buildings where as-built conditions differ from original approved drawings. The inspector arrives, sees discrepancies, and the project is put on hold.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Always conduct a measured site survey before starting drawings. Verify ceiling heights, existing wall positions, structural elements, service locations, and incoming utilities. Design based on actual conditions, not old drawings.</p>

      <h2>10. Starting Work Before Permit Issuance</h2>
      <p>Some contractors begin demolition or structural work while approval is pending — to "save time." DM inspectors conduct random site visits and can issue stop-work orders for unpermitted works. Stop-work orders create complications for subsequent approvals and can delay the entire project by months.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Never begin construction or demolition before the DM fit-out permit is in hand. Planning and procurement can proceed, but no site works until approval is received.</p>
