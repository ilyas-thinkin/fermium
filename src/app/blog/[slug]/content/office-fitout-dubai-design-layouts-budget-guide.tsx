        Fitting out an office in Dubai involves more decisions than most business owners expect — from space planning and layout strategy to material choices, authority approvals, and contractor selection. This guide covers everything you need to know before your project begins.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Your Space Requirements</h2>
      <p>Before any design work begins, the brief must be established. This means defining your headcount (current and projected over 3–5 years), departmental adjacencies, collaboration vs. focus work ratios, storage needs, reception and meeting room requirements, and any specialist spaces — server rooms, prayer rooms, mother's rooms, pantries.</p>
      <p>In Dubai, a common planning benchmark for modern offices is 8–12 sqm per person for open-plan environments. This rises to 15–20 sqm per person for executive and hybrid layouts. Getting the brief wrong at this stage leads to costly design changes later.</p>

      <div className="pro-tip">
        <strong>Pro Tip</strong>
        Plan for 20–30% growth when sizing your fit-out. Adding a partition or restructuring a floor plan after construction is completed is significantly more expensive than designing for future capacity from the start.

      <h2>Office Layout Options in Dubai</h2>
      <p>The three primary office layout models each have distinct characteristics relevant to Dubai's market:</p>

      <h3>Open Plan</h3>
      <p>The dominant layout in Dubai corporate offices. Maximises desk density, promotes visibility and communication, and is the most cost-efficient to build. The main challenge is acoustic management — open-plan offices in Dubai regularly have issues with noise, which must be addressed through acoustic ceiling tiles, soft furnishings, and dedicated quiet zones.</p>

      <h3>Activity-Based Working (ABW)</h3>
      <p>Growing rapidly in Dubai, especially in professional services and tech firms. Staff have no assigned desks — instead, a variety of zones (focus booths, collaboration tables, phone booths, lounge areas) accommodate different work modes. Requires more careful space programming and a cultural shift for many organisations.</p>

      <h3>Cellular / Private Office</h3>
      <p>Traditional layout with enclosed offices for senior staff and open-plan for others. Higher construction cost per person but remains preferred in legal, finance, and healthcare sectors where confidentiality and hierarchy matter.</p>

      <h2>Key Design Elements for Dubai Offices</h2>
      <p>Several design considerations are specific to the Dubai market:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thermal comfort:</strong> HVAC zoning is critical — Dubai's climate means HVAC is running year-round, and poorly zoned systems create hot and cold spots that affect productivity</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer room:</strong> Required for commercial offices above certain occupancy thresholds under UAE labour regulations — plan for this from the start</li>
        <li><strong>Reception quality:</strong> Client-facing reception areas carry significant brand weight in Dubai's business culture — this is not a place to cut costs</li>
        <li><strong>Pantry / kitchen:</strong> Staff amenity expectations in Dubai are high — a well-equipped pantry with sufficient capacity is standard</li>
        <li><strong>IT and AV infrastructure:</strong> Design the cable management, server room, and meeting room AV from the start, not as an afterthought</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Authority Approvals for Office Fit-Outs</h2>
      <p>Office fit-outs in Dubai require approval from Dubai Municipality (DM) for architectural and MEP works, and Dubai Civil Defence (DCD) for fire safety systems. The process typically takes 3–5 weeks for straightforward office projects.</p>
      <p>Key approval requirements for offices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum toilet provision based on occupancy (UAE Building Code)</li>
        <li>Accessible toilet for projects above certain sizes</li>
        <li>Means of escape widths and travel distances to fire exits</li>
        <li>Fire detection and suppression systems coordinated with the building</li>
        <li>DEWA-compliant electrical installation</li>
      </ul>
